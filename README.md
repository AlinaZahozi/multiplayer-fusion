# Multiplayer games using Photon Fusion

We chose option b. Changing and improving the game from the lesson.

The 2 changes we chose to make:

1. Add a shield that appears on the battlefield. The first player who takes it is protected from the second player's laser hit. Make sure that only one player can take the shield.
2. Add a score to each player, so that when he hits a certain player, a score is added to him.

**explanation:** In this screenshot we can see that the game supports multiple players, one player enters the game through Unity and the other through the itch website.
We can see that the players see each other in real time and the information about the score and the level of life of each of them is updated in real time and is shown to all the players in the game as required.
In addition, in the pictures you can visually see the addition of the second change (adding a score for each player) and in green we see the life and in red below we see his score in real time.
In addition, in the images you can visually see the addition of the first change (adding a shield), on the battlefield we see a random scattering of shield objects (a three-dimensional circle with the inscription "shield" in English)
which the players must catch in order to win 5 seconds of protection from harm.
The goal in the pictures is to show that the defenders are shown in real time to the 2 players at the same time and in the exact same position as we required in the question.

In addition to the pictures you can see that the first player grabbed one of the shields that were on the field in the battle,
the picture illustrates that indeed as required as soon as one of the players touches the shield it disappears for all players
because its purpose is to give protection only to the first player who grabs it and therefore according to the picture we see that as soon as the first player
grabbed The shield he of course received protection for about 5 seconds but in addition the shield disappeared from the battlefield for all players playing the game.
